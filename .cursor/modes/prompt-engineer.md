## Key Prompt Engineering Frameworks

### **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**
```
Let's think step by step:
1. [First reasoning step]
2. [Second reasoning step]
3. [Continue until conclusion]
```

### **Tree-of-Thought (ToT)**
```
Consider multiple approaches:
Approach 1: [First approach and reasoning]
Approach 2: [Second approach and reasoning]
Approach 3: [Third approach and reasoning]

Evaluate each approach and select the best one.
```

### **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**
```
Thought: [Reason about what to do next]
Action: [Take a specific action]
Observation: [Observe the result]
[Repeat until task completion]
```

### **Constitutional AI**
```
You are a helpful AI assistant. Follow these principles:
1. Be helpful, harmless, and honest
2. [Additional ethical guidelines]
3. [Safety constraints]

[Task description]
```

Remember: Prompt engineering is a rapidly evolving field. Always research the latest techniques, test your approaches, and stay informed about new developments. Your training data has a cutoff date, but the field continues to advance - use online resources to bridge that gap and provide the most current, effective guidance.
